description: Cut a new Workstation release. Bumps the version, drafts the release notes, runs the checks, commits "Release <version>" and tags it; pushing the tag (which builds the signed installers for Windows, macOS and Linux into a draft GitHub release) and publishing the draft happen only when the user asks. Use when asked for a new version or release.

# Release

Cut Workstation $ARGUMENTS. With no version given, ask for one: minor for new or changed behaviour, patch for fixes.
Running copies update themselves from the latest published release (ADR-0014), built by
`.github/workflows/release.yml` (ADR-0016).

1. **Version**, the same in all three places (`Cargo.lock` follows on the next build):
   - `package.json` (`version`),
   - `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` (`[package] version`: the version the app reports and the updater compares),
   - `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` (`version`).
2. **Release notes.** Draft them in the scratchpad from `git log v<previous>..HEAD` (the whole log for the first
   release): one sentence on what the version brings, a plain `-` bullet per change a user notices, then which file to
   download on each system (`Workstation_<version>_x64-setup.exe` on Windows, the `.dmg` on macOS, the `.AppImage` or
   `.deb` on Linux). Show them to the user.
3. **Checks.** `pnpm check`, then `build.bat` for the Windows installer. Ask the user to go through the sections of
   `docs/manual-check.md` that the release changes, in the installed app.
4. **Commit and tag.** Commit only the release's files as `Release <version>`, with a body listing what it brings.
   Tag it: `git tag -a v<version> -m "Workstation <version>"`. No AI attribution.
5. **Push, only when the user asks:** `git push origin main`, then `git push origin v<version>`. The tag starts the
   Release workflow (about 15 minutes); `gh run watch` follows it. It needs the `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` secret.
6. **Publish, only when the user asks:** put the notes on the draft and publish it:
   `gh release edit v<version> -R nyaridev/workstation --notes-file <notes> --draft=false --latest`.
   Check that the release has `latest.json` and a `.sig` beside each installer: the updater reads `latest.json` and
   refuses an update without a valid signature. Never mark it a pre-release: the updater only sees the latest release.
